**Reflection:**  
Write 1–2 paragraphs about what you learned and why it matters. Connect it to everyday security habits or the workplace. i learned that my password could be figured out in 8 hours and i learned how to figure out someones password but figuring out the someone could get my password in 8 hours showed me that i need to chnge it to something longer so i dont get hacked. and i learned how to get to my assignments and how the class is going to be that is important to know because i wont know what to do.
